# Arceus X DLL

A improved API for Arceus X!

# Synapse X API! 
Inject this and any script will be passed to the arceus x api and then passed to this script. This script is very useful for executing scripts that maybe impossible to execute using something like arceus x. The script itself adds commands to runtime so that the script gets ahold of the executor and uses it to add certain functions.

# Installing/Using Arceus X Plus Plus
Get the file from releases and put in autoexec! Upon executing your scripts can now run! Enjoy Dark Dex, Infinite Yield, Dark Hub, and More!

# Unsupported Scripts
Anything that uses your executor version and blocks you if you are on a certain executor. A workaround is spoofing the executor. Script will be made but it needs even more permissions that the executor may not support.

# UNC Supported

With UNC this makes script even more enjoyable and easy to use.
